Sonic math adventure was created for
gamers like me and you however,I have 
managed to make it into a math game! It's
used as a math resource mainly aimed at year
3-16. (school year). Here is a quick totorial
on how to play the game.
1.go to github.com/crystallisedmoon45/Sonic-Math-Adventure

DO NOT COPY THE CODE. Instead, to. the right of
your screen. You will see a "Raw" button do not press that
as it will show ALOT of code. Press the download button
once its downloaded, click on the download icon if 
you have chrome. it will say choose what app to open
this .html file click on google chrome. You will get a 
new tab on google chrome with the game. When your done with
the game, close the tab. if your concerned about the
security of your computer, go to file explorer and
